Welcome to my blog!

This blog is going to be about why I chose software engineering, my journey and my dreams (and a couple references to legends) 

I graduated high school from Southern California in 2010, graduated from Cal State LA in 2016 and decided to start all over in 2018.  

After graduating with a B.A in pre-law. I studied for my LSAT, took it and surprisingly did pretty well on it and I even worked in the law field for 2 years but ultimately decided I did not want to pursue something I had no passion for (cliche, I know, but the thought of 250k+ in loans kept me up at nights). After some thought, some soul searching, some googling and deliberation with my family I decided to pursue a career  in a field that I have always had passion for, technology. Growing up I loved watching movies (I’ll reveal why), especially movies that were set in the future. Movies like, Demolition Man, Total Recall, RoboCop, Back To The Future and The Jetsons cartoon. Today, technological concepts that are in those movies are so intertwined in our daily lives that we often ask ourselves how we survived without them. Things like Phones, powerful laptops/tablets, self driving cars, Artificial Intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, social media, jetpacks, robotic pets and companions, personal assistants (Google, Alexa and Siri walk into a bar…) to this day blow my mind and I want nothing more than to be a part of that next thing we used to only see in movies and I believe my vessel to that is software engineering. 

My journey to where I am today was anything but traditional, so far I have just been learning and picking things up along the way and ultimately applying that into my goal of becoming a software engineering. I didn’t use a computer until 6th grade in the school library, I didn’t own a laptop until freshman year of high school and I didn’t have a phone until my sophomore year, I was never hands on with technology unfortunately but those were the circumstances at the time. You may ask, why was it not traditional? Well, let me tell you. 

I was born and raised in Afghanistan and in 2001, when I was 9 years old my families application for immigrating to the u. Life was not simple in Afghanistan, there were constant challenges and struggles but my parents made sure we lived a privileged life and faced no shortcomings. When we moved to America - that too was challenging. War is all Afghanistan has known for over 40 years now, so coming from that to America, with all of its advancements, infrastructure, the technological advancements, the never ending tv channels and the amazing fast-food. It was wild, but I absorbed it all like a sponge. I would watch TV to learn how to speak English, by 5th grade my accent was gone. Anything that I thought would help me become “normal” and fit in, I did. Eventually after moving from coast to coast a few times, falling in the community college trap, transferring out, graduating with a degree for the sake of making my parents happy, working in the legal field and hating it, and some health issues along the way, I finally landed on a field that I could see myself have a long and fun future in. 

As the great Nipsey Hussle said, “The marathon continues”, I know this is only the beginning of my journey in the tech field and as a software engineer and at the end of my journey I hope I have made a positive impact and become part of something that will benefits my children and generations to come. I 


And finally, as the legend Kobe Bryant once famously said, the journey is the dream and I hope this journey leads me to something greater than my dreams.
